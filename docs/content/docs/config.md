dbtective uses a YAML configuration file (`dbtective.yml`) to define the rules and checks that will be applied to your dbt project. This file should be placed in the root of your dbt project.

## Complete Example

Since everyone hates reading documentation they don't need. Let's start with a complete example of a `dbtective.yml` configuration file:

```yaml
manifest_tests:
  # Ensure all models and sources have descriptions
  - name: "models_must_have_description"
    type: "has_description"
    severity: "error"
    applies_to: ["models", "sources"]
    description: "All models and sources must have a description."

  # Enforce snake_case naming for all objects
  - name: "naming_convention"
    type: "name_convention"
    description: "All objects must follow the snake_case naming convention."
    pattern: "snake_case"
    severity: "error"

  # Warn if staging models lack descriptions
  - name: "staging_description_warning"
    type: "has_description"
    severity: "warning"
    applies_to: ["models"]
    includes:
      - "models/staging/**"
    description: "Staging models should have descriptions."

  # Ensure mart models have descriptions (excluding deprecated)
  - name: "marts_must_have_description"
    type: "has_description"
    severity: "error"
    applies_to: ["models"]
    includes:
      - "models/marts/**"
    excludes:
      - "models/marts/deprecated/**"
    description: "All mart models must have descriptions."
```


## Rule Configuration

Each rule in the `manifest_tests` array can have the following properties:

### Required Properties

#### `type`
**Required** - Specifies the type of check to perform.

Available check types:
- `has_description` - Ensures objects have descriptions
- `name_convention` - Enforces naming conventions

### Optional Properties

#### `name`
**Optional** - A custom name for the rule. If not specified, the rule type will be used as the name.

```yaml
manifest_tests:
  - name: "models_must_have_description"
    type: "has_description"
```

#### `severity`
**Optional** - The severity level when the rule fails. Defaults to `error`.

Available values:
- `error` - Causes dbtective to exit with code 1 (default)
- `warning` - Reports the issue but doesn't fail the check

```yaml
manifest_tests:
  - type: "has_description"
    severity: "warning"
```

#### `description`
**Optional** - A human-readable description of what the rule checks.

```yaml
manifest_tests:
  - type: "has_description"
    description: "All models and sources must have a description."
```

#### `applies_to`
**Optional** - Specifies which dbt object types the rule should apply to. If not specified, default targets for each rule type will be used.

Available targets:
- `models` - dbt models
- `seeds` - dbt seeds
- `sources` - dbt sources
- `tests` - dbt tests
- `snapshots` - dbt snapshots
- `analyses` - dbt analyses
- `macros` - dbt macros
- `exposures` - dbt exposures
- `metrics` - dbt metrics
- `semantic_models` - dbt semantic models
- `saved_queries` - dbt saved queries
- `hook_nodes` - dbt hook nodes
- `sql_operations` - dbt SQL operations

```yaml
manifest_tests:
  - type: "has_description"
    applies_to: ["models", "sources"]
```

**Note:** Not all check types support all targets. Each rule type has specific valid targets. dbtective will validate your configuration and report an error if you use an invalid target for a rule type.

#### `includes`
**Optional** - A list of file path patterns to include. Only objects matching these patterns will be checked. Patterns can use glob syntax.

```yaml
manifest_tests:
  - type: "has_description"
    includes:
      - "models/staging/**"
      - "models/marts/**"
```

#### `excludes`
**Optional** - A list of file path patterns to exclude. Objects matching these patterns will be skipped. Patterns can use glob syntax.

```yaml
manifest_tests:
  - type: "has_description"
    excludes:
      - "models/staging/deprecated/**"
      - "models/temp/**"
```
