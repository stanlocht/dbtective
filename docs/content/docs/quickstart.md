All possible checks can be found in the [checks documentation](/docs/checks). Information about customizing `dbtective` is shown at the [config documentation](/docs/config)

1. Create a `dbtective.yml` config file in the root of your dbt project by running:

More about the `init` (it also supports `pyproject.toml` or `dbtective.toml`) command is available in the [init documentation](/docs/running/cli#init).

```bash
dbtective init
```

Inspect the contents of the generated `dbtective.yml` file and modify it to fit your project's needs.

2. (Optional) Generate the dbt manifest and catalog files if you haven't done so already. Most dbt commands automatically generate the `manifest.json`, but if you want to ensure both files are up to date, run:

```bash
dbt compile
dbt docs generate
```

3. Run `dbtective` in the root of your current directory or specify an entry point if your dbt_project is not located in the root/current drectory.

```bash
dbtective run
dbtective run --entry-point "my_dbt_project"
```

4. Review the output and fix any issues found.

5. (Optional) Integrate `dbtective` into your CI/CD pipeline or pre-commit hooks to automate checks on every commit and/or pull request.
