# 🕵️ dbtective

dbtective is a Rust-powered 'detective' for `dbt metadata` best practices. As your dbt project grows, keeping metadata consistent and high-quality can become a real challenge.

**dbtective** makes it easy to spot and fix common issues, examples:

- **Missing descriptions:** Does every model and seed have a description?
- **Column types:** Are all columns explicitly typed?
- **Ownership:** Do all sources have an owner?
- **Naming conventions:** Are all marts following your team's naming standards?

We detect and enforce these rules in your `pre-commit` and `CI/CD` pipeline, so fast you will barely notice🕵️
