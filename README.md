# 🕵️ dbtective

dbtective is a Rust-powered 'detective' for `dbt metadata` best practices. As your dbt project grows, keeping metadata consistent and high-quality can become a real challenge.

Explore the [full documentation](https://feliblo.github.io/dbtective/docs) or the [possible checks](https://feliblo.github.io/dbtective/docs/checks).

> [!WARNING]
> dbtective is currently in very early stages.
> Issues and commits are welcome, but don't rely on us yet!

**dbtective** makes it easy to spot and fix common issues, examples:

- **Missing descriptions:** Does every model and seed have a description?
- **Column types:** Are all columns explicitly typed?
- **Ownership:** Do all sources have an owner?
- **Naming conventions:** Are all marts following your team's naming standards?

We detect and enforce these rules in your `cli`, `prek`/`pre-commit` and `CI/CD` pipeline, so fast you will barely notice🕵️.

```yaml
- uses: feliblo/dbtective@v0.1.19
  with:
    config-file: "dbtective.yml"
    entry-point: "."

</details>

<details>
<summary>prek/pre-commit</summary>

Prerequisite: `dbtective` is installed via one of the methods above.

We (currently) recommend using the `--only-manifest` flag with prek/pre-commit to avoid issues caused by `catalog.json` mismatches. For more details, see the explanation in the [checks documentation](https://feliblo.github.io/dbtective/docs/).

Add the following to your `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.

```yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/feliblo/dbtective
    rev: v0.1.19
    hooks:
      - id: dbtective-run
        args: [--only-manifest]
```

And run

```bash
prek install
prek run --all-files
# or with pre-commit
pre-commit install
pre-commit run --all-files

```

## Quickstart

All possible checks can be found in the [checks documentation](https://feliblo.github.io/dbtective/docs/). Information about configuring `dbtective` is shown at the [config documentation](https://feliblo.github.io/dbtective/docs/config)

### Example

1. Create a `dbtective.yml` config file in the root of your dbt project. For example:

```yaml
manifest_tests:
  - name: "models_must_have_description"
    type: "has_description"
    severity: "error"
    applies_to: ["models", "sources"]
    description: " models and sources must have a description."

  - name: "naming_convention"
    type: "name_convention"
    description: "Everything must follow the naming convention."
    pattern: "snake_case"

 - name: "all_marts_must_be_tagged"
    type: "has_tags"
    severity: "warning"
    applies_to: ["models"]
    tags:
      - "mart"
    description: "All marts must be tagged with 'mart'"
```

2. Run `dbtective` in the root of your current directory or specify an entry point if your dbt_project is not located in the root/current drectory.

```bash
dbtective run
dbtective run --entry-point "my_dbt_project"
```
